### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sonia Hussain, and I am a Junior Software Developer. I'm from Birmingham, UK and currently work at GDS (Government Digital Services). 

I'm currenrly honing my skills in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Databases and Frontend Development ðŸŒ±

ðŸŽ“ **Learning Journey:** I completed an intensive Web Devopment Bootcamp at Le Wagon (end of June 2023). This was a great stepping stone into software development as it allowed me to make 10000000s of mistakes during my learning. 

ðŸš€ **Bootcamp Highlights:** A great achievement was when I led a team of anime enthusiasts, in creating [Anime Trek](https://github.com/CodeSonia/anime-trek) where users are able to search for anime and look up further information, as well as earning points âœ¨ for adding anime to their watchlist, writing reviews and adding comments. As well as building upon my technical skillset, I developed soft skills such as collaboration, communication, project management and [presentation skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3Wqv_YkVXA).

âœ¨ **From Marketing to Dev:** I switched my career from marketing => civil service => software development (in civil service). Over the past couple of years, I've dabbled in HTML, CSS, JS and some Python.
